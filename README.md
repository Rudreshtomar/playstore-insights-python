## 📈 **Business Insights**

The analysis delivers the following insights to improve decision-making:

1. **App Rating Trends** – Focus on improving user satisfaction to target the ideal rating range (4.0–4.5).
2. **App Size Optimization** – App size doesn't guarantee higher installs, so optimize size for performance.
3. **Free vs Paid** – Freemium strategy is widely adopted; developers can consider in-app purchases.
4. **Category Performance** – Prioritize high-performing categories like **Productivity**, **Tools**, and **Health & Fitness**.
5. **Content Rating Strategy** – Broader audience apps (rated "Everyone") tend to perform better.
